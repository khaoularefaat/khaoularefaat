🌟 **About Me**  
I am a junior Data Scientist with strong skills in machine learning, data analysis, and web development. I gained hands-on experience during a 5-month internship at OCP, working on predictive modeling in an industrial environment. Curious, rigorous, and highly motivated, I am passionate about solving real-world problems through data. I hold a Master’s degree in Data Science & Engineering and have completed several impactful academic and professional projects.
